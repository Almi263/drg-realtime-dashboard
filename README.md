# Group-F-Capstone
Group F Capstone Project

## Description
This project will address a critical enterprise communication problem: organizational data is spread across departments and tools, forcing teams to rely on emails and manual updates that delay decision-making and prolong real-time status. Our system will:
	•	Combine real-time data, reports, and documents from multiple enterprise platforms into a single centralized dashboard.
	•	Integrate seamlessly with Microsoft tools including Teams, Power BI, Power Automate, and Dynamics.
	•	Maintain compatibility with common business applications and file formats such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Access, and Nitro.
	•	Provide shared visibility across departments, eliminating isolation of information and redundant communication.
By unifying live updates and references from all departments into one accessible platform, this system reduces information fragmentation, minimizes reliance on mass email notifications, and improves operational clarity and efficiency across the organization.
